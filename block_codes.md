#   Block codes

Here is my code:

    var x = 100;
    const dog = 'snickers';

And here is the same with lang name - _this is prefered_
```javascript
    var x = 100;
    const dog = 'snickers';
```

Example with php:
```php
$age = 50;
$name = "wes";
echo strtoupper($name);
```

Example without adding language name
```
echo "hello"
```

Inline code example `const x = 100;` you do like that.

Showing diff - _great for github_
```diff
var x = 100;
- var y = 200;
+ var y = 300;
```
